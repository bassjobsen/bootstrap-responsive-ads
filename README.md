Based on device (screenwidth / viewport) different formats of graphic banners are shown. Also the banner postion change.
Banners of the following formats are used: 160x600, 728x90, 468x60 and 320x50 (width x height in pixels).

Only loads banners which will be used. Every banner load is a real view for your stats. Banners will not resized or hide by CSS.
